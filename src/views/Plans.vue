        <p>My priority right now is to get a software development job, for a company with a mission I believe in.  </p>
        <br />
        <p>I'm interested in both frontend and backend development.  </p>
        <br />
        <p>I have the most experience in Javascript, both for the web and NodeJS. I'm comfortable with frontend design, HTTPS networking, API design, and databases.</p>
        <br />
        <p>I have experience with several JS frameworks, include VueJS, ReactJS, and lots of smaller npm libraries.   </p>
        <br />
        <p>I'm also interested in lower level languages, like C++. I'm especially interested in the low level architecture of browsers, JS engines, and web frameworks. </p>

        <p>In my free time, I'm working on a personal project called Rooftop Media.  The project will be hosted at www.rooftop-media.org.</p>
        <br />
        <p>When I get the time to continue this project, I'd like it to be a non-profit software company. </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The main website would be a webapp, with software to help average people manage practical concerns in their day to day lives. 
        </p>
        <br /><br /><br />
        <p>For example, I'd like to make personal finance tools, recipe and meal tracking tools, household chore and errand management tools, etc.</p>
        <br />
        <p>I'd also like it to have tools to help people make progress on personal projects, like stories, comics, and animations. </p>
        <br />
        <p>The software would be available on our online platform, which could also provide user file storage and messaging.</p>
        <br /><br /><br />

        <p>This project is a longterm goal, that I expect to revise.  For now, I'm looking for more career experience at a good company.</p>
